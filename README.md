Hello, this is a basic website that I built for myself to practice django and html. It is designed to be a very basic social media platform for sharing pictures of pets with likes, comments, and other basics like user authentication. It is meant for now to simply be run locally on a computer, although transitioning it to a fully functional website wouldn't require too many more steps.
